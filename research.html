                <h4>Current research</h4>
                <p>
                    During the past decades, quantum-mechanical simulation methods have developed extraordinarily,
                    and now provide a unique tool to predict and understand the structural and electronic properties
                    of complex materials. 
                    <br>
                    Most of my work focuses on the application of such methods to study functional oxides, including
                    ferroelectrics, magnetoelectric multiferroics and compounds undergoing metal-insulator transitions.
                    <br>
                    This family of oxides attracts much interest because of both their novel physical properties as well
                    as the many existing and prospective device applications, ranging from memories, sensors and transducers
                    to materials for energy harvesting or catalysis.
                    <br>
                    I study bulk compounds as well as nanostructured composite systems in which interfacial and surface phenomena
                    have a great impact in (and sometimes allow to tune) the properties. I am also interested in methodological and
                    theoretical developments, which I tackle whenever needed to solve specific materials-science problems.
